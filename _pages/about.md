## Biography
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Central South University, advised by Prof. Yongmin Zhang in the Transparent Computing Lab (led by Academician Yaoxue Zhang).  
I also visited Rutgers University (ECE Dept.) in 2024 under the supervision of Prof. Jennifer Chen (ACM/IEEE/NAI Fellow).  

My research focuses on **wireless acoustic sensing, indoor localization, and resource optimization for edge computing**. I have published 7 papers in top conferences and journals (SenSys, INFOCOM, Globecom, WCNC, ISPA, TMC), including 3 as first author (CCF A ×1, CCF B ×1).
